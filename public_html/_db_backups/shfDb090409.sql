The buildings, all structurally sound, contain 451 large, irreplaceable apartments of which at least 80% are occupied primarily by low income families. &nbsp;In every case, the neighborhood demographics indicate very low incomes, but there is pressure from gentrification with nearby buildings experiencing successful conversion to luxury use.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n	<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n		<span style=\"color: #696969\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">There is a critical need to preserve the buildings in our program for the more than 1,000 low and moderate income residents who otherwise would not be able to stay in their neighborhoods. <strong>Typically, the cost of renovation is $100,000 per apartment. Today it costs over $350,000 to build a new two bedroom apartment that would be much smaller than the units in the buildings we are renovating. </strong>With municipal funds provided through the City&rsquo;s Third Party Transfer Program, the City&#39;s Department of Housing Preservation and Development is providing loans at no more than one percent interest to cover most of the costs. These funds are scarce, and it is important to use them wisely. &nbsp;It is complicated work, but with a bright outcome.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style=\"color:#696969;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Five rehabilitated buildings are now four limited equity cooperatives, making homeownership a reality for 148 low-income former renters and new residents alike.
