					<p>Settlement Housing Fund is a nonprofit developer of affordable housing and neighborhood amenities working to revitalize and strengthen communities throughout New York City.  Since 1969, we have developed 55 projects with over 8,700 apartments -- rentals, cooperatives, and two-family houses -- that are home to more than 25,000 low and middle income residents, including formerly homeless people.  Whenever possible, we incorporate commercial  developments, community services and programs  for children, young adults and families that provide opportunities for educational success and upward mobility.</p>

				<p>In the late 1980s, Settlement Housing Fund began the rehabilitation of 15 buildings in the devastated Bronx neighborhood of Mt. Eden to create 993 apartments that are home to more than 3,400 people. Today, New Settlement is a vibrant community with programs like the College Access Center and the Parents Action Committee, which provide important resources to the neighborhood's youth and families.<br/><br/>
				Settlement Housing Fund and New Settlement are now partnering with the School Construction Authority to build a new pre-K - 12th grade public school with a community center and swimming facility that will bring further revitalization and significant education, recreation and arts resources to the community. </p>
